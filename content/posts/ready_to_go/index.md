I heard the song *Ready to Go* by Republica on the radio and it got me thinking about
*Top Thrill Dragster*, roller coasters, and how I had to seek treatment for anxiety to
keep riding them.

I wasn't an adrenaline-seeker as a child. During the summer our family would often visit
Land of Make-Believe in New Jersey, but apart from some fairground rides, it was
the waterpark that was the main attraction. I guess it was there that I *technically* got
my first coaster credit on *Thriller*, an E&F Miler oval layout with maybe a ten-foot drop.
That little ride didn't exactly launch my roller coaster obsession however.

My first "real" coaster was a big step up from the little *Thriller*, and it was
*Superman the Ride* at Six Flags New England, formerly *Bizarro* and before that
*Superman - Ride of Steel*. If you're familiar with the ride you're probably thinking
that's an ambitious first ride, and you'd be right. There are some taller, faster,
more intense coasters out there, but it's really the full package with a 200+ foot drop
sustained ejector and floater airtime, intense positive Gs in the spaghetti bowl section,
and all with wide open trains without anything obvious to hold on to. If I were to discover
the joys of roller coasters all over again, let's say it's not what I would have started with.
