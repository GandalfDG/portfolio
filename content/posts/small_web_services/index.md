Things are a little scary out there. I'd like to share what I've learned about
setting up my own little quiet space on the internet.

When Elon bought Twitter I stopped using it. I had been enjoying finding people
doing cool art and making cool stuff on there, but enough was enough. I moved to
a Mastodon instance, and while things were quiet to start with they've grown steadily
and I now have more people I follow, more followers, and more interaction with posts
than I ever had back on Twitter. And it's not just about numbers. I have meaningful
conversations with people on topics from photography to pinball to game development,
where on Twitter it all just felt like a contest for engagement farming.
