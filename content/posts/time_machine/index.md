Over the past several months I've started to become more serious about playing pinball. From visiting many local arcades, to improving my skills, to participating in the New
England Pinball League (NEPL), the next step was to get a machine of my own.

When I first started playing regularly I never really thought I would have the time, space,
or money to own a machine. When I was out of commission for a week with intense sciatica
though, I came to the realiztion that my other passion of visiting amusement parks to
ride rollercoasters was probably not going to remain viable for my health. At that point I
started to consider purchasing something.

The new *John Wick* machine from Stern caught my eye with an exciting theme, a cool art
package, and nice-looking toys in the premium version. I started talking with folks in the
pinball community about it but was cautioned that it might not be a good starting point for
a new owner since as a brand-new machine the current code it's running is fairly light.
They suggested that I might get bored with it while waiting for its full potential to be 
realized. While I was a little deflated following my own excitement about that particular 
machine, I started looking at nearby listings on the 
[Pinside marketplace](https://pinside.com/pinball/market).

Almost right away I happened upon a listing for a Data East *Time Machine* in good condition
that was not far from home and was going for a reasonable price. This machine caught my eye
because I had played it before at a nearby arcade and noticed a very cool gimmick that it has.
During play you'll travel back in time to the 70s, 60s, and 50s (from the present 80s of course)
and when you reach the 50s the game has physical chimes to replicate the sound of those original
electromechanical games. On top of the fun gimmicks I really enjoy the non-licensed theme of the
game which makes it something that anyone could be interested regardless of knowing anything
about an IP that the machine is tied to.

    incandescent glow coming from the machine.](feature_uncropped.jpg "Time Machine on the day we got it home")

## Transport
Getting this massive thing on to and off of a truck and into our basement was a bit of an ordeal.
I intended to rent a van from Home Depot to transport the pin in, but when I arrived they only
had flatbed trucks available. While this worked, it resulted in having to lift the machine to nearly
shoulder-height rather than loading it into a much more reasonable vehicle.
