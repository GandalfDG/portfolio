Over the past several months I've started to become more serious about playing pinball. From visiting many local arcades, to improving my skills, to participating in the New
England Pinball League (NEPL), the next step was to get a machine of my own.

When I first started playing regularly I never really thought I would have the time, space,
or money to own a machine. When I was out of commission for a week with intense sciatica
though, I came to the realiztion that my other passion of visiting amusement parks to
ride rollercoasters was probably not going to remain viable for my health. At that point I
started to consider purchasing something.

The new *John Wick* machine from Stern caught my eye with an exciting theme, a cool art
package, and nice-looking toys in the premium version. I started talking with folks in the
pinball community about it but was cautioned that it might not be a good starting point for
a new owner since as a brand-new machine the current code it's running is fairly light.
They suggested that I might get bored with it while waiting for its full potential to be 
realized. While I was a little deflated following my own excitement about that particular 
machine, I started looking at nearby listings on the 
[Pinside marketplace](https://pinside.com/pinball/market).
