## 🛠️ Working On

Reimplementing the PhysicsBehavior node and its derived nodes for the
[Godot Pinball Toolkit](/projects/godot_pinball) to follow the "call down
signal up" methodology that Godot prefers. I definitely tried to add some
fancy features prematurely and made physics code harder to follow. This
simplified implementation should give a better basis for the physics interactions.

    - still dialing in the frame positioning to get rid of unwanted ankle supination
