## 🛠️ Working On

Creating a custom design for Kiersten's website to better match her personal brand.
I started with a Hugo template but it was limited and didn't really match her style.

Starting to work more seriously on helping my wife produce musical children's
content for her *Ms. Kiersten's Music Corner* concept. Learning to shoot footage
for chroma keying, and designing 3D sets for backgrounds in Blender.

Reimplementing the PhysicsBehavior node and its derived nodes for the
[Godot Pinball Toolkit](/projects/godot_pinball) to follow the "call down
signal up" methodology that Godot prefers. I definitely tried to add some
fancy features prematurely and made physics code harder to follow. This
simplified implementation should give a better basis for the physics interactions.
