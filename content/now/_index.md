## üõ†Ô∏è Working On

Bought myself a pinball machine, a Data East Time Machine. Having a lot of fun playing it
and have already repaired some minor issues and ordered parts for other fixes. I've started
reverse engineering the ROM with Ghidra to see about fixing some bugs and possibly adding
QOL features like a timed ball-save.

Creating a custom design for Kiersten's website to better match her personal brand. I started with a Hugo template but it was limited and didn't really match her style. Check it out at [mskiersten.com](https://mskiersten.com)

Starting to work more seriously on helping my wife produce musical children's content for her _Ms. Kiersten's Music Corner_ concept. Learning to shoot footage for chroma keying, and designing 3D sets for backgrounds in Blender.

## The Back Burner

Reimplementing the PhysicsBehavior node and its derived nodes for the
[Godot Pinball Toolkit](/projects/godot_pinball) to follow the "call down signal up" methodology that Godot prefers. I definitely tried to add some fancy features prematurely and made physics code harder to follow. This simplified implementation should give a better basis for the physics interactions.
