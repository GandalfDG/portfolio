## 🛠️ Working On

I've been too busy for blogging, but that's because I've been shooting and now
editing the pilot for my wife's children's TV show *Lilypad Library!* It's a show
incorporating puppets and live actors to talk about neurodivergent issues and emotional
intelligence. I think she aims to be a Mr. Rogers for today's kids (not that Mr. Rogers has lost his relevance.)
She's going to show off this pilot in a few weeks at the KidScreen conference in San Diego,
so I'm working my butt off on it!

Here are some pictures from filming and during the editing process.
