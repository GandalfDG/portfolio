## üõ†Ô∏è Working On

My wife and I bought our first house! It was built in 1925, but most of the appliances were replaced
within the past few years. It has an amount of built-in storage space to match the year it was built,
but it's nothing a few trips to Ikea can't fix. I have discovered a minor leak which I need to go up
into the attic to investigate, but I remain optimistic. It's nice no longer being a tenant, and there's
something intoxicating about drilling holes in walls and making a place truly my own.

Home projects are now taking the majority of my free time, but I've found a few
hours to sit down and start playing the copy of [Earthborne Rangers](https://earthbornegames.com/the-game/) which we ordered about a year
ago on the recommendation of Shut Up and Sit Down's [glowing review](https://www.shutupandsitdown.com/videos/review-earthborne-rangers/).
It's sort of a piece of solarpunk future fantasy, which is a nice world to escape into with the help
of simple yet intricate deckbuilding mechanics.

I was able to finish the pilot for my wife's childrens television concept, *Lilypad Library* in
time for the Kidscreen conference where she pitched the project to a lot of interesting people who
seemed very interested in her work in turn. You can watch the pilot on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpcV3pngPI8) 
and if you like it please share it with parents of young children and anyone
else who enjoys puppets sharing wisdom about mental health and inclusion.

## üåû Touching Grass

Still haven't touched much grass, but moving was a real workout. The weather is warming
up though, so I'm looking forward to getting out and exploring our new town by rollerblade.
