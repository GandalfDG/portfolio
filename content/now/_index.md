## 🛠️ Working On

I've started streaming somewhat regularly on my [Twitch Channel](https://www.twitch.tv/gandalfdagreat)! A random
Amazon screwup led to me receiving four tripods rather than the one I ordered, so now I have one mounted above
my pinball machine. I've been streaming my [Time Machine](/posts/time_machine), as well as some Pinball FX
virtual tables and working on developing my own virtual pinball engine in Godot. Follow my channel to get notified
when I go live. I usually stream pinball on Fridays at 7 P.M. Eastern and game development on Saturday evenings.
