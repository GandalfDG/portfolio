I'm Jack, a Computer Engineer who's looking to branch out from my current software engineering career path
and work on something more **hands-on**. 
{{< /lead >}}

My ideal job would involve development for consumer products that you can **hold in your hand** and explain to non-technical people.
With that goal in mind I created this site to show off my skills **outside of pure software.** Listed below are some school
and personal projects that I've worked on over the years that have really captured my interest and helped me to learn
new things beyond what I work on at my day job.
