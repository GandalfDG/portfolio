summary: I designed and assembled a custom PCB and wrote C++ software with FreeRTOS for a small autonomous vehicle as part of my senior design project team.

{{< lead >}}In my senior year at RIT I was part of a team tasked with building a small vehicle to replace the vehicle
provided for the defunct *Freescale Cup* competition.{{< /lead >}}

Programming the microcontroller for the *Freescale Cup* vehicle was also used as part of the curriculum for the 
*Interface and Digital Electronics* course for Computer Engineering majors. As the car was no longer being produced,
a substitute needed to be designed to allow the project to continue being used for the class.

## The Freescale Cup

The *Freescale Cup* was a competition to program a standard vehicle with a microcontroller to navigate around an arbitrary
track using only input from a simple camera. The track was made up of white plastic sections with a black line along each edge.
The general strategy was to process the camera input and use it to steer the vehicle and control its speed. A simple software
implementation could drive the car around the track successfully, but to achieve better times more complex algorithms could be
developed to increase straight-line speed, and improve cornering performance among other optimizations.

Using standardized vehicle hardware and track construction allowed the *Freescale Cup* to be a competition focused on software
development, without the vehicles themselves providing advantages from other modifications. Unfortunately after Freescale was
acquired by NXP the competition was phased out, as was the physical vehicle. Since the car was being used as part of the Computer
Engineering curriculum at RIT, a replacement was needed.

Now the NXP cup seems to be back with a newly designed vehicle, but at the time of our project in 2018 it had been phased out.
